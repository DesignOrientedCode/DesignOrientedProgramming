Eureka! By combining the full power of HTML design with the vast capabilities of text grammar programming languages there is finally a path forward to restore substantive innovation to computer programming languages. Design-oriented language is precisely what is needed to provide higher levels of accessibility and usability to support the learn to code movement.\r\n>\r\n\r\n![Book Cover](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DesignOrientedCode/DesignOrientedProgramming/master/bookcover.jpg)\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n* [Print Version - COLOR 170 pages](http://www.amazon.com/Design-Oriented-Programming-Beyond-Text-Barrier/dp/1496068653) <br>\r\n* [Print Version - BLK 100 pages](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Design-Oriented-Programming-Beyond-Barrier/dp/1499130732) <br>\r\n* _Kindle versions were discontinued due to formatting errors._ <br>\r\n* Github and HTML formats are in the works! <br>\r\n* [Wikipedia: Design-Oriented Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design-Oriented_Programming) <br>\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n![Comparison of Assembly Conventional Design Code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DesignOrientedCode/DesignOrientedProgramming/master/AssemHighDesign.jpg)\r\n\r\n<br><br><div></div><br>\r\n***\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n<br><br><div></div><br>\r\n![Translation Optimization] (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DesignOrientedCode/DesignOrientedProgramming/master/TranslationOptimization.jpg)\r\n\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<hr><hr>\r\n<br><br>\r\n\r\n<h1>Find the Parrot!</h1> \r\n<h3>Boost visual search speed using the full optical bandwidth of your hardware.
